# CocoER: Aligning Multi-Level Feature by Competition and Coordination for Emotion Recognition
This is the official implementation of "CocoER: Aligning Multi-Level Feature by Competition and Coordination for Emotion Recognition", in CVPR2025. We propose a multi-level image feature refinement method for emotion recognition (CocoER) to mitigate the impact caused by conflicting results from  multi-level recognition. First, we leverage cross-level  attention to improve visual feature consistency between hierarchically cropped head, body and context windows.  Then, vocabulary informed alignment is incorporated into the recognition framework to produce pseudo label and guide hierarchical visual feature refinement. To effectively fuse multi-level feature, we elaborate on a competition process of eliminating irrelevant  image level predictions and a coordination process to enhance the  feature across all levels. Extensive experiments are executed on two popular datasets, and our method achieves  state-of-the-art performance with  multi-level interpretation results.

Coming Soon.
